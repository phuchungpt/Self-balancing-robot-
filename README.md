****** What is the purpose of each file? ******
Project code: Contains the source code for the Self-Balancing Robot, including algorithms for balancing, 
sensor data processing (e.g., gyroscope, accelerometer), motor control logic, and any communication protocols
used to control or monitor the robot.

Test the controller: Scripts and test cases specifically designed to evaluate the functionality of the 
robot’s microcontroller. This ensures that the control logic is correctly implemented and the robot can 
balance under different conditions, responding accurately to sensor input.

Synthesize images and videos: A compilation of images and video clips taken during the development and 
testing phases of the Self-Balancing Robot project. These media files provide visual documentation of
the robot’s construction, performance during tests, and the final working model.

Project presentation: A slide deck used for presenting the Self-Balancing Robot project. It includes an 
overview of the project goals, technical challenges, the design process, hardware and software components, 
testing results, and project conclusions.

Project report: The detailed final report that summarizes the entire Self-Balancing Robot project. It 
covers the problem definition, objectives, technical design (hardware and software), system implementation, 
testing methodologies, results, and a reflection on the project outcomes.
